# snow_2025_9

Skeleton assessment for snow crab. Run 'buck_read_results.R' before knitting 'SAFE__snow_gmacs.Rmd'. Each folder starting with '24' holds an assessment model version. If more are added, they need to be pointed at within 'buck_read_results.R' or 'SAFE_snow_gmacs.Rmd' (depending on which version of GMACS they were made with...long story).
